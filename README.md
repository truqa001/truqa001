 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I began my journey in software engineering after completing a diploma in multi-media design. My interest in creating functional solutions inspired me to explore the technology behind it. I switched my major to Software Engineering, where I learned programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and discovered my love for problem-solving.

Throughout my studies, I delved into different areas of software development, from front-end web development to back-end systems, and worked on personal and team projects. After graduation, I started my career as a full-stack software engineer, where I continue to learn, grow and explore new technologies. I am passionate about building elegant solutions that make a difference, and I'm excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.
